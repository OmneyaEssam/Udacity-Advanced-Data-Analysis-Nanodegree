# flight Delays and cancelations
## by Omneya Essam


## Dataset
The Dataset used is the [RITA daset](http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/the-data.html) which contains flight data from the US airports and carriers. It contains data from 2013 till the 
current time. I chose The data from 2016 till 2020. This data contains a lot of good information. It contains the number of flights that each carrier in an airport made per month.
It also contains the amount delays and cancelations for each carrier and airport.The detaset includes about 70,000 observations.We will try to resolve the following questions:-

what is the reason behind most delays ?
what is the reason behind most cancellations?


## Key_insights
* Weather was not the main factor of delays or cancelations. Infact weather contributed to only 3.3% of the overall cancelations and arround 7% to the overall delays.
This was against my expectations because I thought that the number one reason for delays and cancelation was the weather. The main reason for cancelations and delays was that the aircraft arived late.
* Weather delays happen in both winter and summer equally. This was an intresting point for me as I knew that flights can be delayed for hot weather. Winter has rain, snow and blizrads so I expected the number of delays and cancelations in the winter will go up. 
In summer delays happen because the aircraft's equipment may have some malfunctions in hot weather, thus needing time to cool of or time to be maintined.
* The insights also demonstrate the 20 Top US cities that have weather delays. The number one city being Texas.
* OD has the largest number of flights and VX has the smallest one
* Canceled flights are mostly in Winter as seen in the plot ( jan and feb and march )
* Summer months have a deacrese in number of flights
* California has the largest number of flights
* there is HIGH correlation between weather delay and and weather cancellation
